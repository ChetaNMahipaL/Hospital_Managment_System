# Hospital Management System Database

## Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive database management system for a hospital, encompassing all aspects from patient records to equipment inventory. This multi-phase project demonstrates proficiency in database design, normalization, and implementation.

## Key Features
- Complete database solution for hospital operations
- Covers patient management, doctor schedules, treatments, and inventory
- Implements CRUD operations, complex queries, and data analysis

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis and System Design
- Defined problem statement and database specifications
- Identified key entities: Patients, Doctors, Treatments, Equipment, etc.
- Established relationships between entities
- Outlined functional requirements for the system

### Phase 2: ER Diagram Design
- Created a comprehensive Entity-Relationship diagram
- Visualized relationships and cardinalities between entities
- Ensured the diagram accurately represented the system's complexity

### Phase 3: Relational Model and Normalization
- Transformed ER diagram into a relational model
- Applied normalization techniques (1NF, 2NF) to optimize database structure
- Ensured data integrity and minimized redundancy

### Phase 4: Implementation and Query Development
- Developed SQL code for database creation and manipulation
- Implemented key operations:
  - Insertions (e.g., new doctors, patients, equipment)
  - Updates (e.g., doctor salaries, department managers)
  - Deletions (e.g., departed staff, obsolete equipment)
  - Complex retrievals (e.g., aggregate functions, projections)
- Created advanced queries for data analysis and reporting

## Technical Highlights
- Designed and implemented a normalized database structure
- Developed complex SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis
- Implemented data integrity constraints and relationships
- Created a user-friendly interface for database operations

## Skills Demonstrated
- Database Design and Modeling
- SQL Programming
- Data Normalization
- Entity-Relationship Diagramming
- Requirements Analysis
- System Design
